Project Description

How do Londoners get around? Transport for London (TfL) is a vast public transport network that allows London's residents to efficiently travel around the UK's capital,
to the tune of over 1.5 million journeys per day!
In this introductory project, you will work with a Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, 
or Databricks database containing data on journeys and transport types in London between 2010 and 2022. 
You will write SQL queries to find the most popular transport methods, examine when the London cable car (which connects London's Royal Docks, 
where the Mayor's office is located, to Greenwich Peninsula, home of the O2 arena) was particularly busy, 
and identify rare periods when the Underground (also known as "the tube" to locals) was less busy.

While the City of London is a little over one square mile (hence its nickname "The Square Mile"),
Greater London has grown to encompass 32 boroughs spanning a total area of 606 square miles! 

Given the city's roads were originally designed for horse and cart, 
this area and population growth has required the development of an efficient public transport system! Since the year 2000, 
this has been through the local government body called **Transport for London**, or *TfL*,
which is managed by the London Mayor's office. Their remit covers the London Underground, Overground, Docklands Light Railway (DLR), 
buses, trams, river services, roads, and even taxis.

The Mayor of London's office make their data available to the public [here](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset). In this project, 
you will work with a slightly modified version of a dataset containing information about public transport journey volume by transport type.
